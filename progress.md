# SQL Practice Website - Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
A SQL practice platform with backend API and frontend interface for learning SQL through interactive problems.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API (`/backend/`)
- **Frontend**: React application (`/sql-practice-platform/frontend/`)
- **Database**: SQL-based problem storage and validation

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Backend Development
- ✅ Core server setup (`backend/src/server.js`)
- ✅ SQL controller implementation (`backend/src/controllers/sqlController.js`, `sqlControllerV2.js`)
- ✅ Problem management service (`backend/src/services/problemManager.js`)
- ✅ Validation service (`backend/src/services/validationService.js`)
- ✅ Database connection and configuration
- ✅ Extensive problem dataset (100+ SQL problems via multiple batch scripts)
- ✅ Problem validation and quality assurance systems
- ✅ Connection fixes documented (`CONNECTION_FIXED.md`)
- ✅ Validation system fixes documented (`VALIDATION_FIXED.md`)

### Frontend Development
- ✅ React application structure
- ✅ Core components (Navbar, pages for Home, Practice, Problems, Progress)
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling setup

### Database & Data Management
- ✅ Database initialization scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive problem datasets from Fortune 100 companies
- ✅ Schema validation and repair systems
- ✅ Backup and restore functionality
- ✅ Quality audit systems

### Documentation & Testing
- ✅ Setup instructions (`SETUP.md`)
- ✅ Demo documentation (`DEMO.md`)
- ✅ Frontend testing instructions (`FRONTEND_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
- ✅ Scaling strategy (`SCALING_STRATEGY.md`)
- ✅ Working test validation (`WORKING_TESTS.md`)

## Current Status 🔄
