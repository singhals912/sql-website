# ‚úÖ SQL Practice Platform - FIXED & WORKING!

## üéØ **The Issue Was Fixed:**
- **Problem:** Database tables weren't being created in the executor environment
- **Solution:** Fixed database setup to create default tables on backend startup
- **Result:** SQL queries now execute successfully against real data!

## üß™ **Test These Working Examples:**

### **Test 1: Basic SELECT Query** ‚úÖ
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/practice
2. Enter: `SELECT * FROM customers;`
3. Click "Run Query"
4. **Expected Result:** 3 customer records displayed in table

### **Test 2: Filtering Query** ‚úÖ  
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/practice
2. Enter: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';`
3. Click "Run Query"  
4. **Expected Result:** 1 customer (John Doe from New York)

### **Test 3: JOIN Query** ‚úÖ
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/practice
2. Enter:
   ```sql
   SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_id, o.total_amount 
   FROM customers c 
   JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
   ```
3. **Expected Result:** 3 rows showing customer names with their orders

### **Test 4: Aggregation Query** ‚úÖ
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/practice  
2. Enter:
   ```sql
   SELECT country, COUNT(*) as customer_count 
   FROM customers 
   GROUP BY country 
   ORDER BY customer_count DESC;
   ```
3. **Expected Result:** Country counts (USA: 1, UK: 1, Canada: 1)

### **Test 5: Problem-Specific Environment** ‚úÖ
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/problems
2. Click on "Select All Customers" problem
3. **Expected Result:** 
   - Problem description loads
   - Specific test data is set up automatically
   - You can solve the problem with real SQL execution
