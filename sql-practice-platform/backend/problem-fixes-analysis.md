# Problems 1-10 Analysis & Fixes

## Summary of Issues Found

**Problems Needing Fixes: 4 out of 10**
- Problem 2: Major mismatch between description and solution
- Problem 3: Complete disconnect between fraud detection description and premium filtering solution  
- Problem 4: Overly complex solution doesn't match schema
- Problem 9: Description mentions different criteria than solution implements

## Detailed Analysis

### ✅ Problem 1: A/B Test Results Analysis - **GOOD**
- **Status:** No issues found
- **Description:** Clear and matches solution
- **Schema:** Proper setup with ab_test_results table
- **Solution:** Correctly calculates conversion rates by test group
- **Expected Output:** Matches solution logic

### ❌ Problem 2: ABN AMRO Corporate Banking - **MAJOR ISSUES**
- **Current Issue:** Description talks about PD, LGD, RAROC (complex banking metrics) but solution only does basic risk score averaging
- **Problem:** Description mentions "PD > 3%, LGD > 40%, RAROC > 15%" but these fields don't exist in schema
- **Fix Needed:** 
  - Simplify description to match the actual risk analysis being performed
  - Remove references to advanced banking metrics not in the data
  - Update description to: "Find industry sectors with high average risk scores for monitoring"

**Proposed Fix:**
```sql
-- Updated description should be:
"Find industry sectors with average risk scores above 5.0 for enhanced monitoring."

-- Solution remains the same (it's actually correct for this simpler problem):
SELECT client_industry, AVG(risk_score) as avg_risk
FROM corporate_risk_profiles 
GROUP BY client_industry 
HAVING AVG(risk_score) > 5.0 
ORDER BY avg_risk DESC;
```

### ❌ Problem 3: AIG Insurance Claims Fraud - **MAJOR ISSUES**
- **Current Issue:** Description is about fraud detection with composite scores and 90th percentile analysis
- **Problem:** Solution only filters policies by premium amount - completely unrelated
- **Schema Mismatch:** References fraud-related fields that don't exist
- **Fix Needed:** Align description with the premium filtering that the solution actually does

**Proposed Fix:**
```sql
-- Updated description should be:
"Identify high-premium insurance policies (>$50,000) that require enhanced scrutiny due to higher potential fraud risk."

-- Solution is actually correct for this simpler problem:
SELECT policy_id, policyholder_name, annual_premium,
       ROUND(annual_premium / 1000, 2) as risk_score
FROM aig_policies 
WHERE annual_premium > 50000
ORDER BY annual_premium DESC;
```

### ❌ Problem 4: AT&T Customer Service - **MODERATE ISSUES**  
- **Current Issue:** Description is excellent with edge cases but solution is overly complex
- **Problem:** References table `att_service_calls` but setup uses `service_calls`
- **Solution Issues:** Uses advanced CTEs and edge case handling but basic schema doesn't support it
- **Fix Needed:** Simplify to match the actual schema provided

**Proposed Fix:**
```sql
-- Simplified description:
"Calculate customer service resolution rates by category to identify improvement areas."

-- Updated solution to match simple schema:
SELECT service_category,
       COUNT(*) as total_calls,
       AVG(call_duration_minutes) as avg_duration,
       (COUNT(CASE WHEN resolution_status = 'Resolved' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as resolution_rate
FROM service_calls
GROUP BY service_category
ORDER BY resolution_rate DESC;
```

### ✅ Problem 5: Adobe Creative Cloud - **GOOD**
- Simple aggregation problem with clear requirements
- Solution correctly implements HAVING clause filtering
- Expected output matches solution logic

### ✅ Problem 6: E-commerce Customer Analytics - **GOOD**  
- Clear join-based analysis problem
- Schema supports the required joins
- Solution properly calculates customer metrics by tier

### ✅ Problem 7: Amazon Prime Video - **GOOD**
- Simple GROUP BY + HAVING problem
- Clear requirements and matching solution
- Expected output aligns with query logic

### ✅ Problem 8: Social Media Engagement - **MOSTLY GOOD**
- **Minor Issue:** Description could be more concise
- Solution correctly aggregates engagement metrics
- Schema supports all required calculations

### ❌ Problem 9: American Express Credit Portfolio - **MODERATE ISSUES**
- **Current Issue:** Description mentions "allocation >15%, return >8%" but solution calculates utilization rates
- **Problem:** Solution doesn't implement the stated filtering criteria  
- **Fix Needed:** Either update solution to match criteria or align description with utilization analysis

**Proposed Fix:**
```sql
-- Updated description should focus on utilization analysis:
"Analyze credit utilization patterns across customer segments to understand risk levels."

-- Current solution is actually good for utilization analysis:
SELECT customer_segment,
       COUNT(*) as account_count, 
       AVG(credit_limit) as avg_credit_limit,
       AVG(current_balance / credit_limit * 100) as utilization_rate
FROM amex_credit_portfolio
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY utilization_rate DESC;
```

### ⚠️ Problem 10: Apple App Store - **MINOR ISSUES**
- **Minor Issue:** Expected output shows duplicate/versioned game categories which look odd
- Functionally the problem works correctly
- Consider cleaning up test data to show more realistic category names

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Must Fix):**
1. Problem 2: Update description to match risk analysis reality
2. Problem 3: Rewrite description to match premium filtering logic  
3. Problem 4: Simplify solution and align with schema

**Medium Priority:**
4. Problem 9: Align description with utilization analysis focus

**Low Priority:**
5. Problem 10: Clean up duplicate category names in test data

## Next Steps

1. Update problem descriptions in database to match actual solutions
2. Verify all expected outputs match updated solutions
3. Test each fixed problem to ensure correctness
4. Update any schema mismatches identified
5. Review error handling for edge cases
