### ⚠️ Problem 16: Charles Schwab Wealth Management - **MINOR ISSUES**
- **Current Issue:** Description is overly complex for what the solution actually does

- **Fix Needed:** Simplify description to match the actual filtering being performed

-- Updated description should be:
"Analyze Charles Schwab's wealth management client portfolios to identify high-performing, 
low-risk investment strategies. Find wealth tiers with annual returns above 10% and 
portfolio volatility below 18%."

-- Solution is actually appropriate for this simpler description:
SELECT wealth_tier, portfolio_millions, annual_return_pct, volatility_pct
FROM schwab_wealth_management 
WHERE annual_return > 0.10 AND portfolio_volatility < 0.18
ORDER BY annual_return_pct DESC;
