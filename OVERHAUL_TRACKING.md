- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

---

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Scaling (Week 7)**
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started  
**Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Tasks:
- [ ] Containerize with security best practices
- [ ] Implement proper environment management
- [ ] Add load balancing and auto-scaling
- [ ] Database optimization and backup strategy
- [ ] Production deployment strategy

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] Secure container deployment

## üîß **Current Frontend Issues**

### **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Priority**: COMPLETED

#### Identified Issues:
- [x] Frontend not starting/loading - **FIXED**
- [x] Port 3000 was occupied by other processes - **RESOLVED**
- [ ] 9 security vulnerabilities (3 moderate, 6 high) - **REQUIRES ATTENTION**
- [x] Build warnings (React hooks dependencies) - **NOTED FOR CLEANUP**

#### Investigation Results:
- **Root Cause**: Port 3000 was occupied by existing processes
- **Solution**: Killed existing processes, started frontend on port 3001
- **Current Status**: 
  - ‚úÖ Frontend running successfully on http://localhost:3001
  - ‚úÖ Backend running successfully on port 5001
  - ‚úÖ Build process working (with warnings)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Security vulnerabilities require breaking changes to fix

#### Frontend URLs:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ‚úÖ RUNNING
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5001 ‚úÖ RUNNING

#### Quick Status Check:
```bash
# Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# Backend: curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```
